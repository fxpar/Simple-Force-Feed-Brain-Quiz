# Simple-Force-Feed-Brain-Quiz

## start again on wrong answer
A few years ago, Albis Vetsin had a very nice web site with a quiz to learn vocabulary. Many languages were available.
The extra feature of this quiz was that it went back to first question on each wrong answer.

Here is an implementation of this "force feed your brain" quiz.

# Feature
You can simply paste vocabulary from a worksheet (Excel, LibreOffice, Google Sheet...).
* First column is the question.
* Second column is the expected answer
